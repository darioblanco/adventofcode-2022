# Advent of Code 2022

My [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) solutions in Rust.
This repository holds a single Rust project that will run the exercises based
on cmd input.

Each exercise folder has the format `d[0-9][0-9](a|b)` contains an `input.txt` file,
holding the puzzle input.

Simply run the project and select an exercise.

```sh
$ cargo run
